🌟 **Sentiment Analysis Using PySpark: Classification of Textual Data into Positive or Negative Sentiments** 🌟

The primary focus of this project is to utilize PySpark, a robust distributed computing framework for large-scale data processing, for sentiment analysis. The objective is to employ a machine learning approach to classify textual data into either positive or negative sentiments.


📊 **Data**

You can access the dataset used for training and testing the sentiment analysis model by downloading it from the following link: http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/. This dataset comprises labeled movie reviews that are categorized into positive or negative sentiment.


⚙️ **Model Training**

In this project, two machine learning algorithms, namely SVM (Support Vector Machine) and Logistic Regression, are employed. PySpark's machine learning library is utilized to build and train these models. The goal is for these models to understand the patterns and relationships between input text and their corresponding sentiment labels, allowing them to classify unseen text data based on sentiment.


🔬 **Model Evaluation**


Here are the evaluation results for the sentiment analysis models:

🔹 **SVM**
Accuracy: 85.3%

🔹 **Logistic Regression**
Accuracy: 90.6%


These results demonstrate the performance of the models in classifying the sentiment of textual data, with the Logistic Regression model achieving a higher accuracy of 90.6% compared to the SVM model's accuracy of 85.3%.





Happy analyzing! 🚀
